/**
 * Dark mode activation rules, in order of precedence:
 *
 * 1. Light mode by default
 * 2. If prefers-color-scheme is set, follow that.
 *   Note that prefers-color-scheme: light doesn't really do anything since light is already the default.
 * 3. If nx-html--dark-mode or nx-html--light-mode is set, follow that class, regardless of prefers-color-scheme.
 *   Setting both of those classes simultaneously is not advised but will result in dark mode.
 * 4. If nx-html--enable-color-schemes is NOT set, always light mode
